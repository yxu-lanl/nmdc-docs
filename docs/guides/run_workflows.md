##### User Profile
Once logged in, the green button with the user’s initials on the right provides a drop-down menu which allows the user to manage their projects and uploads; there is also a button which allows users to edit their profile. On this profile page, there are two options: 1) the option to receive email notification of a project’s status (OFF by default) and 2) the option to change the user’s password (also OFF by default).
