>NMDC Data Portal Tutorial Practice 
>
>There are many ways to search the microbiome studies available in the Data Portal. This Tutorial will guide you through some of the most common methods.
>
>Task 1: Go to the [NMDC Data Portal](https://data.microbiomedata.org/) and log in with your ORCID account. (You will need to log in to be able to download data/processed data. You can create an account from the login page from the ORCID login link in the top corner of the Data Portal.)
>
>Task 2: Using the map feature (zoom capability and "Search this region" to filter by latitude/longitude), find all the metagenomes collected closest to Corvallis, Oregon. 
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 1: How many metagenomes have been collected near Covallis?
>
>Task 3: Using the Study box (which shows the number of microbiome studies related to the metagenomes identified in Task 2), click the arrow on the right side of this box to get to the Study Page for this study.
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 2:  What is the DOI for this study? (Note: This is also the DOI for the Dataset Citation.)
>
>Task 4: Go back to the main Data Portal page and clear the active query terms in the upper left corner. Use the Collection date option in the left menu bar or the timeline slide feature (below the Omics type and map) to filter to samples collected in 2015.  Use the "search" feature (upper left corner) to find metagenomes collected from freshwater river biomes.
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 1: How many metagenomes were collected from freshwater biomes in 2015?
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 2: What other types of omics data are available for these samples?
